#Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”


list1 = ["Ford Cabrio 1949", "Jaguar E-Type 1966", "Ford Mustang GT 1967", "Cadillac Eldorado 1959", "Hudson Hornet 1951"]

for item in list1:
    print(f"I would like to own a {item}.")
